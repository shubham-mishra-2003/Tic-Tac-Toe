##Project Title: TicTacToe Game

##*Description*:
I developed a web-based TicTacToe game using React.js and the Vite framework, showcasing my proficiency in front-end web development and state management. The project follows a clean and organized file structure with a dedicated "TICTACTOE" folder containing all project-related files.
